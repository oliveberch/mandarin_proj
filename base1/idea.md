## Architecture :

To put it out simply there are only 3 tasks here.
- listen. 
- recognize mandarin. 
- translate it.

## Requirements :

- to capture live audio from the microphone : pyaudio 

- to recognize Mandarin speech : speechrecognition

- to translate recognized mandarin : googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

## Observation

- slow. terribly slow in translation
- not always able to recognize mandarin. might be my mic. need to recheck this.
