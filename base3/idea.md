# Problems with last build

- the audio input is segmented for a short duration
- the processing time to translate is high
- 

# ideas (
- get continous audio stream
- process on it in real time
- share output with user simulataneously


# updates:
- getting consecutive input now

# problem: 
- the new audio is opening into media player. need that directly as output in speaker like how it is working in the 2x volume sample.
- real time processing is a challange
- smaller chunks of audio are not parsed
