# Real-time Mandarin to English Translator

This project aims to develop an application that mimics the functionality of the Indian Defence Forces' Mandarin translator device. The application will be built incrementally, focusing on the following features:

1. Access to live microphone data.
2. Detection of Mandarin speech.
3. Real-time translation of Mandarin to English.
4. Audio output of the translated English text.

## Features

- **Live Audio Input**: The application will access and process live audio data from the device's microphone.
- **Mandarin Detection**: It will detect when Mandarin is being spoken.
- **Real-time Translation**: The detected Mandarin speech will be translated into English in real-time.
- **Audio Output**: The translated English text will be converted back to speech and played through the device.
