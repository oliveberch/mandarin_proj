# Real-time Mandarin to English Translator

This project aims to develop an application that mimics the functionality of the Indian Defence Forces' Mandarin translator device. The application will be built incrementally, focusing on the following features:

1. Access to live microphone data.
2. Detection of Mandarin speech.
3. Real-time translation of Mandarin to English.
4. Audio output of the translated English text.

## Features

- **Live Audio Input**: The application will access and process live audio data from the device's microphone.
- **Mandarin Detection**: It will detect when Mandarin is being spoken.
- **Real-time Translation**: The detected Mandarin speech will be translated into English in real-time.
- **Audio Output**: The translated English text will be converted back to speech and played through the device.

## Background Information

### Army Uses AI to Break Through the Chinese Language Barrier

The Indian Army has adopted sophisticated AI-powered solutions for real-time Chinese to Hindi or English translations, enhancing field operations and joint exercises. The Army Design Bureau (ADB), established in 2016, identified the Chinese language barrier as a critical issue and sought help from the Indian tech industry. In 2018, Cogknit Semantics Private Limited developed a 100% indigenous solution that translates Chinese languages into English or Hindi in real-time without internet connectivity.

The device is a wearable, bi-directional speech-to-speech translator that converts Mandarin and English speech in real-time without network connectivity. It weighs 80-100 grams, has a latency of 3-4 seconds, and a battery life of 12 hours. The system includes wearable devices, docking stations, and re-training servers, making it suitable for tactical use during meetings and engagements.

AI is transforming the defense sector, enhancing training, surveillance, logistics, cybersecurity, and more. The Indian Army uses AI for border monitoring, UAV surveillance, lethal autonomous weapons, autonomous vehicles, and data management. AI also improves intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, and aids in pattern recognition for counter-terrorism efforts.

This project is inspired by the real-world application of AI in the Indian Defence Forces and aims to provide similar capabilities to a broader audience.
